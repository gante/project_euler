        ## Organisation
        
        This project contains two mains folders. In `bin`, the `.py` scripts that produce the response for each problem are present.
        Their execution depends on the contents of the other folder `math`, where the mathematical operations are defined.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Installing JAX with GPU support may need extra steps. Check: https://github.com/google/jax#installation
