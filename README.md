## Organisation

This project contains two mains folders. In `bin`, the `.py` scripts that produce the response for each problem are present.
Their execution depends on the contents of the other folder `math`, where the mathematical operations are defined.

## Installation

Installing JAX with GPU support may need extra steps. Check: https://github.com/google/jax#installation
