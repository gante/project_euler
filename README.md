## Organisation

This project is encapsuled in the `gante_project_euler` folder, which in turn contains two sub-folders.
In `bin`, the `.py` scripts that produce the response for each problem are present.
Their execution depends on the contents of the other folder, `math`, where the key operations are defined.


## Installation

Installing JAX with GPU support may need extra steps. Check: https://github.com/google/jax#installation
